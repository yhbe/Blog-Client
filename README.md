# Introduction
This is the client-side repository for the Blog project, which is part of [The Odin Project's NodeJS curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-blog-api). The project aims to build a restful API that can be used to build a blog client and a blog CMS. The project was built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, and NodeJS).
